# UFOs
## Overview of Project
In this project we took a large Javascript dataset of UFO sightings in the U.S. and Canada in January 2010. I created an HTML page with input boxes so users could easily filter the data and search for sightings based on 5 different criteria. The data is displayed professionally in a table for the user to see clearly on the webpage using HTML. The webpage was then customized using Bootstrap components to make the website more visually appealing to the user. 

## Results
  - The top of the webpage greets you a beautiful picture of the Earth and our title "The Truth Is Out There", followed by a paragraph asking the reader to think about how they view possible extraterrestrial life in the universe. Then on the left hand side we have 5 filter boxes that users can input data in different search criteria, and my code I have written will filter through that large Javascript dataset and find all the relevant data based on a date, city, state, country, or shape of the UFO sighting. The image below shows the webpage and its design:

  - Filling out one or more of these filter criteria instantaneously updates the table to the right in real time with the filtered data, showing in real time exactly what the user is looking for. An example is shown below:

  - This design is the perfect way to test your belief one way or the other about life other than humans out in the universe. 

## Summary
This webpage does a fantastic job of letting people explore the age old question of "Are we alone in the universe?". There is a drawback that could be improved upon and that would be to change the filter input boxes from free typing to a dropdown menu. For instance, the data we have in our Javascript dataset is all lower case so if a user were to mispell or even capitalize a state or city the filter that's built would return no results. My suggestions would be to give a drop down menu to limit mispellings and miscapitalizations by the user resulting in a better user interface. I would also like to add a "clear" button at the bottom of the filters because after typing a couple criteria in, I had to manually go back to each box and clear the input in each box before doing another query of the data. 

**What is your conclusion? Are we alone in the universe, or are there intelligent life forms out there? Happy UFO hunting!**
